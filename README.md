# Speedtest Results Application

This application provides a public history for speedtest results periodically
taken from my home on Barkley Lake. The speedtest data is captured using the
SPEEDTEST CLI tool provided here [https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli)

Note this application uses the commercial Kendo React component library, so usage is governed by their EULA.
